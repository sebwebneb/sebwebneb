I look at game security from both perspectives. Without cheats, there wouldn't be anti-cheats. Both sides drop serious time and money into this, especially when brands are involved. It is always compelling watching a cheat dev actually bypass a million-dollar anti-cheat and outsmart all those experienced developers behind it. 

But honestly, making the cheat is thrilling too. That first time your driver goes undetected after all the hours you put in? You'll never feel that again. On the flip side, anti-cheat work gives you constant wins: seeing those detection logs roll in, always having new loaders to reverse, and new detection methods to create. Most people hate the cat-and-mouse aspect of anti-cheat, but honestly that is exactly why I'm into it. There is always something to tear apart and counter.
