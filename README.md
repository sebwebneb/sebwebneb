I look at game security from both perspectives. Without cheats, there wouldn't be anti-cheats. Both sides drop serious time and money into this, especially when brands are involved. It is always compelling watching a cheat dev actually bypass a million-dollar anti-cheat and outsmart all those experienced developers behind it. 

But honestly, making the cheat is thrilling too. That first time your driver goes undetected after all the hours you put in? You'll never feel that again. On the flip side, anti-cheat work gives you constant wins: seeing those detection logs roll in, always having new loaders to reverse, and new detection methods to create. Most people hate the cat-and-mouse aspect of anti-cheat, but honestly that is exactly why I'm into it. There is always something to tear apart and counter.

### What I am doing
I am a 15-year-old researcher currently active as a junior analyst for Epic Games through HackerOne. Since I don't have access to the massive telemetry data yet, I stay on the frontline. I spend my time lifting virtualized blocks from EAC into Unicorn Engine to see what the instructions are actually doing as this is part of what I need to do to find vulnerabilities. I am deep into analyzing NMI stack walking and dumping P2C loaders. I also make it a point to identify the fraudulent Stripe and PayPal accounts these vendors use for money laundering.

### The Path
I want to be around the engineering that actually pushes Windows internals to the limit.
Until then, I am just documenting my research and reversing "private" loaders for the hell of it.
Soon, I plan to start dumping Valorant cheats so I can help Vanguard for fun while I help EAC.
